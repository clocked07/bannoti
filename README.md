                                        Desktop notifier for banano (https://banano.cc)
                                         by Mateo Cruz  (https://github.com/wolfrust)


```


‚ú®You can use Bannoti to recieve notifications for Banano transactions on your computer. 


---


**For everything below, replace `bannoti.py` with the file in your tree. (`bannoti.exe` on windows and `bannoti` on Linux)**


### Installation

1. Grab [the latest release](https://github.com/wolfrust/bannoti/releases/latest).
2. Unzip the file you just downloaded
3. Open a terminal window
4. [Move into the directory](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal) in which you placed the files
5. Run ```bannoti.py --startup``` to add Bannoti to startup

Step 5 is optional but recommended, because otherwise you will have to start Bannoti manually *every time you log on*, which could get annoying.

---

### Usage (20s) ‚å®

Running ``` bannoti.py --help ``` will show you a nice help message.

```

$> bannoti.py --help


  -- snip --


    bannoti.py <option>

    run : run the program
    --add : add an address to get notified for
    --remove : stop getting notifications for an address
    --gettracked : get tracked accounts
    --startup : add program to startup

    If this is your first time using Bannoti, I recommend you see the README (./README.md).


```

It's pretty straightforward. You don't have to supply any other arguments, just one of these.

For example : `bannoti.py --add`
